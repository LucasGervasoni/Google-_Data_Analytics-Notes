# Variations of the data life cycle

### Six stages to the data life cycle:

- Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

- Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

- Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

- Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

- Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

- Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

### U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the following data life cycle:

- Plan

- Acquire

- Maintain

- Access 

- Evaluate

- Archive


### The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
The USGS uses the data life cycle below:

- Plan

- Acquire

- Process

- Analyze

- Preserve

- Publish/share

Several cross-cutting or overarching activities are also performed during each stage of their life cycle:

- Describe (metadata and documentation)

- Manage quality

- Backup and secure

### Financial institutions
Financial institutions may take a slightly different approach to the data life cycle

- Capture

- Qualify

- Transform

- Utilize

- Report

- Archive

- Purge

### Harvard Business School (HBS)
One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight stages:

- Generation

- Collection

- Processing

- Storage 

- Management

- Analysis

- Visualization

- Interpretation
