# More on the phases of data analysis and this program

Each step in the data analysis process—ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act—plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from data. As you navigate through each phase, from asking the right questions to taking informed actions, you harness the true power of data.

### The ask phase
At the start of any successful data analysis, the data analyst: 

- Takes the time to fully understand stakeholder expectations 

- Defines the problem to be solved

- Decides which questions to answer in order to solve the problem

Qualifying stakeholder expectations means determining who the stakeholders are, what they want, when they want it, why they want it, and how best to communicate with them. Defining the problem means looking at the current state and identifying the ways in which it’s different from the ideal state. With expectations qualified and the problem defined, you can derive questions that will help achieve these goals. 

### The prepare phase
In the prepare phase, the emphasis is on identifying and locating data you can use to answer your questions.

### The process phase
In this phase, the aim is to refine the data. Data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means:

- Cleaning data

- Transforming data into a more useful format

- Combining two or more datasets to make information more complete

- Removing outliers (data points that could skew the information)

After data analysts process data, they check the data they prepared to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting the details right.

### The analyze phase
This is when you turn the data you’ve gathered, prepared, and processed into actionable information. 

### The share phase
This phase is exactly what it sounds like: It’s time to share what you’ve learned with your stakeholders!

### The act phase
The data analysis journey culminates in the act phase, when data insights are put to work.
