## Sort data

Sorting data is the process of organizing information in a meaningful way to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize. It can be done in spreadsheets, SQL databases, or document tables, using criteria like ascending or descending order. This allows for classifying and grouping similar data, helping to gain immediate insights. For example, a company can sort competing resorts by location or size to gather useful information for its own projects.

## Filter data

Filtering data allows you to display only the information that meets specific criteria, hiding the rest. This is useful for focusing on relevant or erroneous data, especially in large datasets. Tools like spreadsheets and SQL databases offer various filtering options. For example, a ski resort design company can use filters to analyze trends based on the number of runs and the acreage of competing resorts.

## Sort a pivot table

A pivot table is a data summarization tool used to organize, group, and sort information. Items in the rows and columns are first sorted by custom lists, and if none are defined, they are sorted in default ascending order. When sorted in descending order, a rule is set that remains even when new data is added. For example, in a ski resort dataset, locations can be sorted alphabetically by state, territory, or country.
