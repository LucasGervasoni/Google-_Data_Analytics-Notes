# File Organization Guidelines - Summary
Objective
Increase the efficiency of data analysis through organized file naming and storage practices.

## Best Practices for Naming Files
Importance
- Facilitates organization, access, and automation of processes.

- Serves as a quick reference for the file’s contents.

## Recommended Components in File Names:
-  Project name: e.g., **SalesReport**

- Creation date: In international format YYYYMMDD — e.g., **20231125**

- Revision version: Include leading zero — e.g., **v02**

- Consistent style and order: e.g., **SalesReport_20231125_v02**

## Additional Tips
- Avoid spaces and special characters. Use underscores (_), hyphens (-), and capital letters.

- Align with existing team or company standards.

- Create a sample file with naming conventions to ensure team-wide consistency.

## File Organization
Folder Hierarchy
- Use folders and subfolders arranged logically:

  - Broad topics at the top.

  - Subfolders for specific content.

## Best Practices
- Separate in-progress files from completed ones.

- Archive old files in dedicated folders or external storage.

# Balancing Data Security and Analytics

## What is data security?

Data security is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption. Its main goal is to prevent unauthorized users from viewing or using sensitive information.

## The challenge

Data analysts need to balance **security** with **quick access** to information in order to generate meaningful and timely insights.  
> Visual representation: a tug of war between **"Data Security"** and **"Access to Data"**.

## Security measures

Two key strategies used to balance security and access are:

### Encryption
- Uses a **unique algorithm** to scramble the data.
- The algorithm is stored as a **key**.
- With the key, it’s possible to **decrypt** the data and restore it to its original form.

### Tokenization
- Replaces the original data with **randomly generated tokens**.
- The real data is stored separately.
- **Authorized access** is required to map the tokens back to the original data.

Both methods protect data even in the event of a security breach.

## Your role as a junior data analyst

- You will likely **not be responsible** for building these security systems.
- Companies usually have **dedicated security teams** or hire **specialized third-party vendors**.
- It’s important to **understand the basics** of data security and the systems your future employer might use.

## Best practice: Version control

- Lets you track **who changed what**, **when**, and **why**.
- Essential for team collaboration and avoiding accidental overwrites.
- Supports testing and experimentation without fear of losing your work.
