### **Importance of databases**  
  - Store, manipulate, and process large volumes of data efficiently  
  - Facilitate the extraction of insights

### **Relational databases**  
  - Data organized in **interconnected tables**  
  - Simplify searches and data joins  
  - Avoid the complexity of non-relational tables that hold all variables together

### **Normalization**  
  - Structures tables and defines relationships to:  
    1. Eliminate data redundancy  
    2. Increase data integrity  
    3. Reduce complexity

### **The key to relational databases**  
  - **Primary key**: column with unique values that identifies each record  
  - **Foreign key**: column that references a primary key in another table  
  - **Composite key**: combination of two or more columns that together are unique  
  - Not every table requires a primary key (e.g., fact tables may only have foreign keys)

### **SQL? You’re speaking my language**  
  - Standard query language for relational databases  
  - Enables selecting, filtering, and joining data from different tables
  
## **Metadata Is as Important as the Data Itself**

Metadata—in other words, “data about data”—provides deeper insight into the content and context of any file or dataset. It answers the questions who, what, when, where, why, and how, making it easier to communicate and reuse information across an organization.

## Key Elements of Metadata

- **File or Document Type**  
  Identifies whether the item is a photo, spreadsheet, email, etc.

- **Date, Time, and Creator**  
  Records when and by whom the file was created and last modified.

- **Title and Description**  
  Names the item and summarizes its contents.

- **Geolocation**  
  For photos, indicates where the image was captured.

- **Tags and Categories**  
  Labels that classify and index the content.

- **Access Permissions**  
  Specifies who can view or edit the data.

## Everyday Examples

1. **Photos**  
   Filenames, timestamps, device type, and GPS coordinates are embedded in image files.

2. **Emails**  
   Sender, recipient, subject line, date/time, plus hidden metadata like message IDs, IP addresses, and server details.

3. **Spreadsheets and Documents**  
   Author, number of pages, comments, sheet/tab names, tables, and column definitions are stored alongside the data.

4. **Web Pages**  
   Meta titles, meta descriptions, author information, tags, and categories help search engines and users understand page content.

5. **Books and Audiobooks**  
   Title, author, publisher, table of contents, copyright details—and for audiobooks, narrator and runtime.

## Why Metadata Matters

- **Organization & Traceability**  
  Keeps data well-structured and easy to locate.

- **Communication & Collaboration**  
  Ensures that analysts and stakeholders understand data context.

- **Governance & Reuse**  
  Supports best practices for data preservation, compliance, and future reuse.

## **Metadata and Metadata Repositories**

Metadata is “data about data.” It explains how, when, and where data was collected and organized, putting raw data into context so analysts can make informed decisions.

---

## Benefits of Metadata

1. **Reliability**  
   - Ensures data is accurate, precise, relevant, and timely.  
   - Helps confirm that the correct datasets (e.g., from a specific year) are in use.

2. **Consistency**  
   - Promotes uniform data formats and collection methods, enabling reliable comparisons across sources.  
   - Consistent data is easier to organize, classify, store, and access.

Together, these qualities empower analysts to solve problems and derive insights faster and with greater confidence.

---

## Metadata Repositories

- **Definition:** Specialized databases—on‑premises or in the cloud—designed to store and manage metadata.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Centralize metadata in a common structure for quick, easy access.  
  - Prevent manual lookups across individual files.  
  - Combine multiple data sources by detailing data state, location, table structures, and access logs.

---

## Metadata of External Databases

- **Second‑Party Data:** Collected directly by another organization and sold.  
- **Third‑Party Data:** Aggregated by intermediaries who did not collect it firsthand.  

**Best Practices:**  
- Review external metadata for consistency and reliability.  
- Confirm permissions and accessibility with data owners before purchase or use.
